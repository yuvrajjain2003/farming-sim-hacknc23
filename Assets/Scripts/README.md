This github repository only contains the scripts or the engine for our Unity Project.
Since we have a lot of assets, in sizes of Gigabytes, it is not feasible to upload all our assets onto GitHub.

If you are interested in using our assets, we will soon work on uploading our Sprites on our website, so be on the
lookout for that in the future.
